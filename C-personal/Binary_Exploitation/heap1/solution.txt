//** Heap1 **//

*Explenation:

After printing the heap convert the two addresses of the 2 variables
into decimal.
Next subtract the smaller number from the greater one. After doing
this you have the number of bytes between the two addresses.
Next you have to add to the end of your string the word pico, the
string before pico has to have the lenght of the difference between
the 2 variables -2. You add pico because you try to overflow the 
second variable with pico to get the flag.

*Example:

0x5a9c8ee312b0  ->   pico
0x5a9c8ee312d0  ->   bico

The difference is 32

Write the following to the buffer to complete the chall:

If the explenation is wrong I'm sorry, but it works :)
