//** Heap0 **//

*Explenation:

After printing the heap convert the two addresses of the 2 variables
into decimal.
Next subtract the smaller number from the greater one. After doing
this you have the number of bytes between the two addresses.
Next overflow the heap adding one byte more than the difference
between the two addresses to the buffer.

*Example:

0xaaaad87456b0  ->   pico
0xaaaad87456d0  ->   bico

The difference is 32

Write the following to the buffer to complete the chall:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

If the explenation is wrong I'm sorry, but it works :)
